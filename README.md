-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey visitor!👋🏻<br>
I'm Dishant Kapadiya, a graduate student at Northeastern University. This repo is a collection of all the awesome things I'm doing in my Web Development class. I recently returned from a coop at New York Life Insurance, where I worked on AWS and some iOS. My interest lies Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Checkout my other repos to see what was I upto on other classes!😉

Check out my latest build on heroku:
